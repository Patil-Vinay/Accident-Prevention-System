# Accident-Prevention-System
Traveling, which was once a necessary part of human life, has now become perilous. With the passage of time, the number of road accidents has increased correspondingly. According to a Times Now poll, over 2 lakh deaths are reported each year as a result of vehicle accidents.

To address this issue, we developed an "Accident Prevention System" with Smart Road Safety, which uses an ultrasonic sensor to identify the danger distance and inform the driver before a collision occurs. 

The project has 4 ultrasonic sensor and a Raspberry Pi as the processing unit. It primarily focuses on preventing accidents by recognizing them before they occur.
