# Accident-Prevention-System
Traveling, which was once a necessary part of human life, has now become perilous. With the passage of time, the number of road accidents has increased correspondingly. According to a Times Now poll, over 2 lakh deaths are reported each year as a result of vehicle accidents.

To address this issue, we developed an "Accident Prevention System" which uses an ultrasonic sensor to identify the danger distance and inform the driver before a collision occurs. 

The project has 4 ultrasonic sensor and a Raspberry Pi as the processing unit. It primarily focuses on preventing accidents by recognizing them before they occur.
